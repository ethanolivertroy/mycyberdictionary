# Breaking into a Career in GRC

5 things to do to break into #GRC:

" Earn a foundational security certification to speak the language of security. CompTIA Security+ is an excellent starting point.

1.  ﻿﻿Learn the cloud by choosing AWS or Azure and earning their entry-level certification. Understanding the terminology and value proposition of the cloud is essential as it's becoming increasingly prominent in the field of cybersecurity.
2.  ﻿﻿Network with GRC professionals who currently hold the job you aspire to and those in higher positions. Networking goes beyond just adding them on LinkedIn. Engage with their posts, exchange messages, and share content they've created to build meaningful connections.
3.  ﻿﻿Pick a cyber compliance framework, such as SOC 2, ISO

27001, or HIPAA, and go all-in on learning it. Dive deep into the intricacies of the framework, study use cases, and read example reports or certifications.

5 Learn in public by consistently sharing your journey into

GRC. Post about what you've learned from the certifications mentioned above, share your challenges, and express your interests to establish yourself as a knowledgeable professional in the field.

GRC is the best entry point into the cybersecurity field, I stand on that.

But just because it's the best doesn't mean it's easy. It requires hard work, consistency, and perseverance.

If you're willing to put in the work, you can pave the way for a successful career in cybersecurity.
