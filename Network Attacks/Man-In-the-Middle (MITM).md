# Man-In-the-Middle (MITM)

A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack is a type of cyber attack where an unauthorized actor inserts themselves into a conversation between two parties, impersonates both parties and gains access to information that the two parties were trying to send to each other.

Here is a breakdown of how a MITM attack typically works:

1. **Interception**: The attacker first intercepts the communication between the victim and the server. This can be achieved in a number of ways, such as by compromising a network or by impersonating a Wi-Fi network.

2. **Decryption**: If the data is encrypted, the attacker must decrypt it. They can do this by using various techniques, such as SSL stripping to downgrade the connection to an unencrypted one.

3. **Eavesdropping or Alteration**: Once the attacker has access to the data, they can either eavesdrop, recording the data for use later, or alter the data before sending it on to the intended recipient. This can be used to spread misinformation, inject malicious code, or steal sensitive data.

4. **Re-encryption and Forwarding**: If the data was originally encrypted, the attacker will re-encrypt it (after possibly altering it) and send it on to the intended recipient. The recipient, unaware of the interception, assumes the data came directly from the original sender.

MITM attacks can be very dangerous because they can be difficult to detect and can result in the theft of valuable information, such as login credentials, personal information, or financial data. They can also be used to inject malware or other malicious content into a data stream. For these reasons, it's important to use secure and encrypted connections, especially when transmitting sensitive data.
