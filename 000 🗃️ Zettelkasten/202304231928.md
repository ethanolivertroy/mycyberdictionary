If you want to prevent ransomware, you need these three controls.

1.  ﻿﻿﻿Patch public-facing vulnerabilities.
2.  ﻿﻿﻿Implement application control so unapproved applications can't run.
3.  ﻿﻿﻿Ensure human response and detection of common ransomware TTPs. See The DFIR Report's yearly report and its
4.  Sigma rules.
