# mycyberdictionary.com

[**mycyberdictionary.com**](https://mycyberdictionary.com) is an attempt to open-source my [**second-brain**](https://fortelabs.com/blog/basboverview/) as it relates to cybersecurity. This project started as my own personal notes & resources in [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that were flexibly documented in markdown and easily searchable for me. I began to share these notes with colleagues, friends, and other people I met that were either interested or had questions about these different topics. I felt like the easiest way for everyone to benefit from this and for me to continue my note-taking process in a productive manner was to turn this part of my second-brain into a [**digital garden**](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). Please excuse the mess as this is not a polished website or blog but a resource in constant iteration.

You can eitherÂ [download this vault](https://github.com/ethanolivertroy/mycyberdictionary)Â locally and open it in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) or browse it via the Obsidian Publish Website here: https://mycyberdictionary.com.
