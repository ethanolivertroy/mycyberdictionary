# Domain Name System (DNS)

The Domain Name System (DNS) functions as a decentralized database, responsible for converting easily understood domain names into IP addresses. As a crucial component of the internet, it operates using a hierarchical organization divided into multiple zones, beginning with the top-level root zone.

Each domain can utilise different DNS record types. Some common DNS record types include:

NS: Nameserver records include the name of the authoritative servers hosting a domain's DNS records.
A: Also called a host record, it contains the IPv4 address of a hostname (e.g. www.exampledomain.com).
AAAA: Also called a quad A host record, it contains the IPv6 address of a hostname (e.g. www.exampledomain.com).
MX: Mail Exchange records include the names of servers responsible for handling a domain's email. A domain can have multiple MX records.
PTR: Pointer Records are utilised in reverse lookup zones to find records associated with an IP address.
CNAME: Canonical Name Records create aliases for other host records.
TXT: Text records can contain arbitrary data for various purposes, such as domain ownership verification.
