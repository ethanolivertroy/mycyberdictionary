To find the host with a web server with the title "Under Construction" in the Module Exercises VM Group 1, you can use the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) with the `http-title` script. Follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal on your Linux machine.

2. Run Nmap with the `-p` flag to specify the HTTP ports (usually 80 and/or 443), the `--script` flag to enable the NSE script, and the target IP range. For example:

```bash
nmap -p 80,443 --script http-title <target_IP_range>
```

Replace `<target_IP_range>` with the actual IP range or list of IP addresses you want to scan in the Module Exercises VM Group 1.

3. Review the output of the command, looking for a host with the title "Under Construction" in the `http-title` script result.

4. Once you've identified the host, you can use a web browser or tools like `curl` or `wget` to access the index.html page on the web server and retrieve the flag.

Please ensure you have permission to perform the port scanning and use NSE scripts on the target IP range, as unauthorized scanning may be illegal or against network policies.
