# ITL4

ITIL 4, short for Information Technology Infrastructure Library, is a set of detailed practices for IT activities such as IT service management (ITSM) and IT asset management (ITAM) that focus on aligning IT services with the needs of the business. It provides processes, procedures, tasks, and checklists that can be applied by an organization to establish a strategy, deliver value, and maintain a minimum level of competency. It allows the organization to establish a baseline from which it can plan, implement, and measure. ITIL is used to demonstrate compliance and to measure improvement. There is no formal independent third-party compliance assessment available for ITIL compliance in an organization, and certification in ITIL is only available to individuals. Since 2021, ITIL has been owned by PeopleCert.

ITIL version 4 was released in February 2019. The main changes with this version were to consider end-to-end Service Management from holistic and value-centric perspectives, align with philosophies such as Agile, DevOps, and Lean, and to reduce the emphasis on IT Service Management in favor of general Service Management.
