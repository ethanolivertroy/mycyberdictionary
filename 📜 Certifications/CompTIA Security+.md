# CompTIA Security+

## Security+ and DoD Compliance

Security+ is a widely recognized certification by the Department of Defense (DoD) and plays a significant role in DoD compliance due to its alignment with the DoD Directive 8140.01 (formerly 8570.01-M). See [[DoD 8570 or DoD 8140]]. This directive requires that all Information Assurance (IA) personnel, contractors, and military members handling information systems within the DoD must obtain industry-recognized certifications that demonstrate their competence in relevant cybersecurity roles.

Security+ certification, administered by CompTIA, is an entry-level certification that covers a wide range of fundamental cybersecurity topics, such as network security, threat management, cryptography, and risk identification. It is approved by the DoD to meet the requirements for the Information Assurance Technical (IAT) Level II and Information Assurance Management (IAM) Level I positions.

The emphasis on baseline cybersecurity knowledge and practical skills provided by the Security+ certification makes it an ideal starting point for personnel working within the DoD environment. As a result, it helps ensure that DoD employees and contractors have the necessary skills to protect sensitive information and maintain compliance with DoD security regulations.
