The Certificate of Cloud Security Knowledge (CCSK) is a widely recognized certification that demonstrates a person's competency in key cloud security issues. It's offered by the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA), a not-for-profit organization that promotes the use of best practices for providing security assurance within cloud computing.

The CCSK is meant to provide individuals with a solid foundation in cloud security issues. The topics covered in the CCSK include:

1. Cloud computing concepts and architectures
2. Governance and enterprise risk management
3. Legal issues, contracts, and electronic discovery
4. Compliance and audit management
5. Information management and data security
6. Interoperability and portability
7. Security in the cloud architecture
8. Business continuity and disaster recovery
9. Operational security
10. Encryption and key management
11. Identity, entitlement, and access management
12. Virtualization
13. Security as a Service

The CCSK is considered a baseline of knowledge for individuals in IT security and related fields, and it's often a stepping stone to more advanced certifications like the Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP) from (ISC)Â². To prepare for the CCSK, individuals often use the CSA's Security Guidance for Critical Areas of Focus in Cloud Computing and the ENISA report on cloud computing risks.
