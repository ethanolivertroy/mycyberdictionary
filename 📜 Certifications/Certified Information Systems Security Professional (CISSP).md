# Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)

## What is the CISSP?

The CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional) is a globally recognized certification in the field of information security. It is administered by the International Information System Security Certification Consortium, also known as (ISC)Â². The CISSP certification is designed to validate an individual's knowledge and expertise in managing, designing, and implementing a secure information technology infrastructure.

To become a CISSP, candidates must meet certain requirements, including having at least five years of full-time, paid work experience in at least two of the eight domains of the CISSP Common Body of Knowledge (CBK). These domains are:

1. Security and Risk Management
2. Asset Security
3. Security Architecture and Engineering
4. Communication and Network Security
5. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
6. Security Assessment and Testing
7. Security Operations
8. Software Development Security

Candidates must also pass the CISSP examination, which is a comprehensive, multiple-choice test that covers the eight domains. The exam is designed to assess a candidate's technical and managerial knowledge and skills required to effectively manage an organization's information security program. Once certified, CISSPs must maintain their certification through continuing professional education and periodic renewal of their credentials.

## Do I really need 5 years of Cybersecurity Experience?

- No, you can get a waiver for certs or school: https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP/Experience-Requirements
- The experience just has to be in 2/5 of the aforementioned domains

## Costs?

- https://www.isc2.org/Register-for-Exam/ISC2-Exam-Pricing
- $750 (exam) + $125 (annual membership fee)

## How I Passed CISSP After Studying for only 10 Days

I basically followed TCM's Advice here:

### Let's be honest here about WHAT this is:
- It is a multiple-choice test exam
- It is an HR filter and will at least get your resume looked at and push you to interviews
- It is **required** in quite a few cases now such as being a Senior FedRAMP Assessor or a [[QSA]]

### Address the waste of time argument everyone has about the CISSP
- If you really want to be a cybersecurity professional, yes, you will need practical experience but you can do that *and* get the cert that increases your marketability (*yes, you don't have to choose between certs and practical experience...who would have thought*)
- Trying to go deep on each of these areas to pass the exam would be **great** but not **required** (do that long term)
- [[Doing What is Required Versus Doing Your Best]]
- Arguing about the exam on social media does nothing for your professional development
- Funny Meme so you can be cool with your friends and make fun of a certification:

### What is required: 
- Doing lots of practice questions- 100s even 1000s if possible to find
	-  There are only so many writers for CISSP questions and only so many ways to evaluate the same content knowledge with questions
	- Train your "learning model" to catch a ton of "looks" as you would train an AI
		- People don't get mad at an untrained AI when it gets things wrong, how would it know. In the same respect, how are you going to answer questions if you have no experience answering questions the type of question you are going to encounter?
- Focusing on the areas  you lack actual experience in (which for me in Networking and Cryptography)
- What are the tough concepts that could trip me up? That cryptography stuff man, lol. 

### What I did:
- Answered every question on [Pocket Prep](https://study.pocketprep.com/) Until I got them all right (800+) multiple times
- Started Using [Boson](https://www.boson.com/practice-exam/cissp-isc2-practice-exam)) and the Sybex Exam Banks and realized they were very similar to Pocket Prep so I honestly ditched them and went back to Pocket Prep
- Watched this entire video (https://youtu.be/_nyZhYnCNLA) straight once and then again but only focused on the parts that didn't make sense to me or areas I was getting questions wrong

### How Did I Find Time:
Everyone that has asked me about CISSP advice has mentioned they are just not finding time to study.
- I did 10-20 question quizzes all day
	- Every bathroom break
	- Upon Waking
	- Before Bed
	- Randomly in the middle of the workday
	- There is time...
