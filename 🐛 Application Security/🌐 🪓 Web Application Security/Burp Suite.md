# Burp Suite

Burp Suite is a popular integrated platform for performing security testing of web applications. It is developed by PortSwigger Web Security. The tool has several key features that support the various stages of web security testing, including:

1. **Proxy**: This allows the tester to intercept, inspect, and modify the raw traffic passing between the client and the server. It is often used to manipulate requests and responses to identify potential vulnerabilities in an application.

2. **Spider**: The Spider tool is used for automatic content discovery. It crawls the application to identify new locations, functionality, and inputs.

3. **Scanner**: Burp Suite's automated vulnerability scanner can be used to identify a variety of security vulnerabilities.

4. **Intruder**: This tool is used for automating custom attacks against a target. It allows you to craft attacks in various ways and analyze the results.

5. **Repeater**: The Repeater tool is used for manually manipulating and resending individual requests and analyzing the responses.

6. **Sequencer**: The Sequencer tool is used for analyzing the quality of randomness in an application's session tokens and other important data items.

Burp Suite comes in two versions: Community (free) and Professional (paid). The Professional version includes a number of advanced features, including the automated scanner and various types of analysis tools.
