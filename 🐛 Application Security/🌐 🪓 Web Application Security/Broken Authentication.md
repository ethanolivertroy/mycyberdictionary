# Broken Authentication

Broken Authentication is a security vulnerability typically found in web applications, and it falls under the broader category of authentication and session management vulnerabilities.

Broken Authentication occurs when the functions related to authentication and session management are implemented incorrectly, allowing attackers to compromise authentication tokens or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users' identities temporarily or permanently.

Common examples of Broken Authentication include:

1. Session ID's exposed in the URL.
2. Unprotected log out.
3. Weak password recovery validation.
4. Passwords, session IDs, and other credentials sent over unencrypted connections.

These vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to log in as a legitimate user simply by guessing or stealing their credentials or session identifiers, thus gaining access to all the privileges of the targeted user.

To prevent Broken Authentication, it's important to:

1. Implement multi-factor authentication.
2. Use strong, unpredictable session identifiers.
3. Automatically log users out after a period of inactivity.
4. Ensure credentials are stored securely (for example, passwords should be hashed and salted).
5. Ensure that all credential and session data is sent over secure connections.

These are just some of the steps that can be taken to reduce the risk of Broken Authentication. It's always recommended to follow best practices for secure coding and to conduct regular security audits of your applications.
