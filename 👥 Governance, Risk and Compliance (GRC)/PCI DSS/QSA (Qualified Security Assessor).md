# QSA (Qualified Security Assessor)

## What is a QSA?

A Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) is a professional authorized by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) to audit merchants for Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard ([[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)]]) compliance. QSAs are trained to understand the complex technical and operational requirements of PCI DSS and are tasked with assessing various businesses' payment card processing environments to ensure the safe handling of cardholder information. They provide advice on remediation efforts if non-compliance is identified and, once all requirements are met, validate the compliance status of the organization by preparing a Report on Compliance (ROC).
