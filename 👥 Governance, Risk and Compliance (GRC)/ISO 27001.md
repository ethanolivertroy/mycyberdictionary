ISO 27001 is an international standard for information security management systems (ISMS) published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). Here's a summary of its key aspects:

1. **Scope**: ISO 27001 is designed to provide a framework for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an information security management system (ISMS). An ISMS is a systematic approach to managing sensitive company information so that it remains secure. 

2. **Risk Management**: The standard focuses on risk-based thinking and emphasizes the importance of risk assessment, risk treatment, risk acceptance, and the continual improvement of the ISMS. It considers all relevant risks and seeks to manage them appropriately.

3. **Requirements**: The standard outlines a set of requirements for establishing and managing an ISMS. These include a risk assessment and risk treatment process, the establishment of objectives, monitoring and measurement of the systemâ€™s performance, and continual improvement processes.

4. **Controls**: The standard includes Annex A, which lists 114 controls in 14 categories that organizations can implement based on the results of their risk assessment. These categories cover areas such as information security policies, human resource security, access control, cryptography, physical and environmental security, operations security, communications security, and business continuity management, among others.

5. **Certification**: An organization can choose to be certified against ISO 27001. This involves an audit by an independent certification body to verify that the ISMS of the organization conforms to the standard. The certification is a means of demonstrating to clients, suppliers, and stakeholders that the organization has implemented best-practice information security methods.

It's important to note that ISO 27001 is suitable for all types and sizes of organizations and can be applied to any information that needs to be protected.
