# General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy in the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA). It also addresses the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas. The GDPR aims to give individuals control over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying the regulation within the EU.

The GDPR was adopted on 14 April 2016 and became enforceable from 25 May 2018. It replaced the 1995 Data Protection Directive.

Key aspects of GDPR include:

- **Consent:** Organizations must request user consent to process their data in a clear and easily accessible manner. The purpose for data processing must also be attached to that consent.

- **Breach Notification:** In the event of a data breach, organizations are required to notify the relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours of becoming aware of it.

- **Right to Access:** Individuals have the right to know what personal data an organization has about them, why they have it, and who they are sharing it with.

- **Data Portability:** Individuals have the right to obtain and reuse their personal data for their own purposes across different services.

- **Right to be Forgotten:** Also known as Data Erasure, individuals can request their data to be erased, ceasing further dissemination of the data.

- **Privacy by Design:** This concept calls for the inclusion of data protection from the onset of the designing of systems, rather than an addition.

- **Data Protection Officers:** Certain organizations will need to appoint a Data Protection Officer to oversee GDPR compliance.

These rights and requirements are aimed at promoting transparency and giving individuals more control over their personal data. Non-compliance with the GDPR can result in hefty fines.
