# Python and Excel

Yes, Python can be used to create, read, and manipulate Excel files. A common library for this is pandas, which can be used with openpyxl or XlsxWriter for Excel-specific functionality.

Here is a simple example on how to create an Excel file with Python:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a dictionary
data = {'Name': ['Tom', 'Nick', 'John'],
        'Age': [20, 21, 19]}

# Create DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Write DataFrame to an excel file
df.to_excel('test.xlsx', index=False)
```

This script will create an Excel file named 'test.xlsx' with the data from the pandas DataFrame. The `index=False` parameter prevents pandas from writing row indices into the spreadsheet.

To run this script, make sure you have the pandas library and the appropriate Excel writer library installed in your Python environment. You can install these with pip:

```
pip install pandas openpyxl
```
or
```
pip install pandas XlsxWriter
```
