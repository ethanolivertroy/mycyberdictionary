# Structured Query Language (SQL)

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a programming language specifically designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. SQL provides a standardized way to interact with databases, allowing users to create, modify, and retrieve data stored in a structured format.

Here are a few key points about SQL:

1. Database Management: SQL is primarily used for managing relational databases. It enables users to create, modify, and delete databases, tables, and other database objects.

2. Data Manipulation: SQL provides commands for inserting, updating, and deleting data within a database. It allows users to retrieve data from one or more tables using queries and filter the results based on specific conditions.

3. Data Definition: SQL allows users to define the structure of a database, including creating tables, specifying data types, defining relationships between tables, and setting constraints to ensure data integrity.

4. Data Querying: SQL provides a rich set of commands to query databases and retrieve specific information. It supports various operations such as filtering, sorting, grouping, and joining data from multiple tables.

5. Data Control: SQL includes commands for managing user access and security within a database. It allows administrators to grant or revoke permissions, create user accounts, and define roles for controlling data access.

It's important to note that SQL is a standard language, but different database management systems (DBMS) may have slight variations or additional features beyond the standard SQL syntax. Examples of popular relational database management systems that use SQL include Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite.
