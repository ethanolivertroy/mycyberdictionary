# Conducting a Risk Assessment Checklist

## Step 1: Categorize the IT System
- [ ] Determine the system's impact level based on its potential to cause harm if compromised
- [ ] Refer to the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 199 and 200 documents for guidance on how to categorize the system
- [ ] Use the NIST Special Publication 800–60, Volume 2, for mapping types of information and systems to security categories
	- [NIST Special Publication 800–60, Volume 1](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-60/vol-1-rev-1/final) 
	- [NIST Special Publication 800–60, Volume 2](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-60/vol-2-rev-1/final)
- [ ] Determine the system's security category based on the highest impact level across confidentiality, integrity, and availability

## Step 2: Select Security Controls
- [ ] Select appropriate security controls based on the system’s impact level
- [ ] Choose from various security control families such as access control, audit and accountability, configuration management, and more
- [ ] Use the NIST SP 800–53 Rev. 5 for reference on all these controls
- [ ] Refer to the NIST SP 800–53b for baselines for low, moderate, and high categorized systems

## Step 3: Implement Security Controls
- [ ] Implement the selected security controls
- [ ] Ensure that they are working as intended
- [ ] Use NIST SP 800–18 to create a System Security Plan (SSP)
- [ ] Include implementation details for your controls in the SSP, along with other system information

## Step 4: Assess Security Controls
- [ ] Test the security controls to ensure their effectiveness
- [ ] Have an independent auditor assess the implemented controls
- [ ] Be mindful of potential bias if choosing to assess the controls yourself

## Step 5: Authorize the IT System
- [ ] Obtain authorization for the system from a designated individual (authorizing official)
- [ ] The authorizing official reviews the audit results, SSP, and any residual risk
- [ ] Make a decision on whether the system is authorized to operate
- [ ] Address findings that can’t be quickly fixed or remediated from the assessment in a Plan of Action & Milestone (POAM) report

## Step 6: Monitor Security Controls
- [ ] Document all system changes
- [ ] Conduct ongoing assessment, risk determination, and remediation
- [ ] Utilize assessor results to improve system security
- [ ] Determine and adhere to the required frequency for reassessment
- [ ] Regularly report the status of the system's security
- [ ] Define and follow a process for the removal and disposal of the system at the end of its lifecycle
