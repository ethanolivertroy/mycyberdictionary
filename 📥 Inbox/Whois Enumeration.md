# Whois Enumeration

Whois enumeration involves using the Whois protocol to gather information about a domain, such as the domain's owner, contact information, registration date, and name servers. You can perform Whois enumeration using command-line tools or web-based services.

Here's how to conduct Whois enumeration:

**Command-Line Tools:**

1. **Linux/Unix/MacOS**: You can use the `whois` command in the terminal to perform Whois enumeration. Simply type `whois` followed by the domain name:

```markdown
whois example.com
```

2. **Windows**: You can use the `whois` command with Windows by installing a third-party tool like Sysinternals Whois. After installation, open the Command Prompt and enter the `whois` command followed by the domain name:

```markdown
whois example.com
```

**Web-Based Services:**

Numerous websites offer Whois lookup services. You can use one of these services by entering the domain name into the search field on the website. Some popular web-based Whois lookup services include:

- [whois.domaintools.com](https://whois.domaintools.com/)
- [whois.icann.org](https://whois.icann.org/)
- [who.is](https://who.is/)
