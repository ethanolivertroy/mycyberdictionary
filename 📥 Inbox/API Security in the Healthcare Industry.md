In this video, Chad Small, CSO, and DevSecOps Lead at Surest, Andrew Mahler, VP of Privacy and Compliance at Clearwater Compliance, and Dan Beran, Founder of API Security University, discuss API security in the healthcare sector. They talk about the challenges faced by healthcare organizations in balancing the security of patient data with the demand for accessibility, as well as the regulatory requirements that must be met. They also discuss the importance of training for developers and fostering relationships between security and development teams. Additionally, they talk about the free courses offered by API Security University to help people become API security experts.
