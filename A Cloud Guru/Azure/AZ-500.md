## <mark> Chapter 1</mark>

- Intro stuff

## <mark>Chapter 2: The Azure AD Identity Platform</mark>

### Azure AD Authentication and Authorization
- Everything changed from on-prem to SaaS + Remote Users + Cloud Services

#### Authentication: The process of verifying who someone is.This might involve a username and password, or other factors as occurs with multi-factor authentication.

#### Authorization: The process of verifying what someone is allowed to do is authorization. This occurs by the system checking the user's assigned permissions.

![[iam.png]]

#### What are the 3 types of Azure roles?

1. Old Azure subscription-level roles use the classic deployment model, but can be used to manage subscriptions.
2. Azure AD roles are used to manage Azure AD resources.
3. Azure RBAC roles are used to manage Azure resources.

### Azure AD Tenant and Azure Subscription Associations

- Azure Active Directory and Microsoft Azure are SEPARATE things
- every Azure subscription can only be associated to one Azure AD tenant
- Azure AD tenant can be associated with multiple subscriptions, but a subscription can only be associated with one Azure AD tenant

### Managing Azure AD Tenant and Azure Subscription Associations

- Azure AD tenant: Azure AD roles</mark>
<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">
- Azure subscription: Azure RBAC roles
</mark>

#### When you transfer billing ownership of an Azure subscription, which role is reassigned?
- The Account/Billing Administrator is transferred when you transfer billing ownership.

### Azure AD Identities

#### Identity Types

![[id-types.png]]

#### Which identity type can be associated directly with an Azure resource (e.g., a virtual machine)?

Managed identities can be associated with or created for an Azure resource, and that managed identity can be used to grant access to other Azure resources.

### <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Lab: Create and Manage Azure AD Users in the Portal</mark>

#### Lab Scenario

To help you walk through the lab, consider the following scenario:

You work as a senior systems administrator, and the management of Azure AD is one of your many responsibilities.
As a senior team member, it's also important that you share your knowledge with other colleagues.
Your manager has recently asked you to provide a walkthrough of basic user management tasks for a group of new Helpdesk team members.
Using an empty demonstration Azure AD tenant you have configured, you are going to demonstrate the following:

- Creating a new user
- Modifying existing user accounts
- Revoking access for users
- Deleting user accounts

#### Lab Setup

Log in to the Azure portal by right-clicking Open Azure Portal and selecting the option to open it in a new private browser window. (This option will read differently depending on your browser ‚Äî for example, in Chrome, it reads Open Link in Incognito Window.) Then, sign in using the credentials provided on the lab page.

The objectives for this hands-on lab can be completed using the Azure portal. Specifically, all tasks will be performed using the Azure Active Directory service pages.

### Azure AD Groups

  ![[groups.png]]

### Azure AD Dynamic Groups

- basically groups auto-configured by some characteristic such as automatically adding users to a finance group based on being employees of the finance department

- can have dynamic groups made up of users or devices but not both

### <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"> Lab: Create and Manage Azure AD Groups in the Portal</mark>

#### Lab Scenario

To help you walk through the lab, consider the following scenario:
You work as a senior systems administrator, and the management of Azure AD is one of your many responsibilities.
As a senior team member, it's also important that you share your knowledge with other colleagues.
Your manager has recently asked you to provide a walkthrough of basic group management tasks and portals for several new Helpdesk team members.
Using an empty demonstration Azure AD tenant you have configured, you are going to demonstrate the following:

- Creating groups
- Modifying group properties
- Working with groups from different portals
- Deleting groups

#### Lab Setup

Log in to the Azure portal by right-clicking Open Azure Portal and selecting the option to open it in a new private browser window. (This option will read differently depending on your browser ‚Äî for example, in Chrome, it reads Open Link in Incognito Window.) Then, sign in using the credentials provided on the lab page.

The objectives for this hands-on lab can be completed using the Azure portal. Specifically, all tasks will be performed using the Azure Active Directory service pages.

Please note we will also look at the different portals that can be used by both administrators and end-users as discussed further in the objectives.

### Note: Other Portals

  

- Microsoft 365 Admin Center

- Microsoft MyApps > My Groups

> Notice the different views for each portal. Also be aware the MyApps Group Management portal is intended for end users and can be used by group owners to manage groups - see this Microsoft article for more information.

### Azure AD Administrative Units

#### Which Azure AD RBAC roles are permitted to create an Azure Active Directory administrative unit?

- A Privileged Role Administrator can create administrative units.

- A Global Admin can create administrative units.

  ![[admin-units.png]]


#### Which Azure AD feature allows you to delegate administrative permissions to a subset of users and/or groups?

- Administrative units allow you to logically group users and groups into a manageable unit that can be used to scope Azure AD RBAC permissions.

  
### Section Conclusion

- ID is the center of everything we do in cloud security and it is the new security perimeter

- Because cloud services sit outside of the control of our traditional corporate firewall, the identity that we still control is now considered the perimeter. However, we may not be able to control where our users might be, what devices they might be on, when they access our applications, and how they use data.

  

## <mark>Chapter 3: Hybrid Identity</mark>

  

### Azure AD Connect and Hybrid Identities

**Focus:** Seamless access to cloud resources

### <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Lab: Investigate Windows Security Events with Microsoft Sentinel Lab</mark>

#### Lab Scenario

  

To help you walk through the lab, consider the following scenario:

  

You work as a cybersecurity engineer, and you have a large Windows server fleet that you need to manage the security for. You are looking at Microsoft Sentinel as a possible solution to collect, detect, investigate, and respond to security threat events.

  

Using an existing resource group, you will complete the following:

  

1. Deploy Microsoft Sentinel by adding it to the existing Log Analytics workspace.

2. Configure the Windows Security Events data connector and enable some of the built-in analytics rules to alert when security events occur.

3. Log in to the Windows VM and perform actions that generate security events.

4. Use Microsoft Sentinel to investigate the incidents created by those events.

  

#### Lab Setup

  

The objectives for this hands-on lab can be completed using the Azure portal and the provided Windows virtual machine.

  

> Note: To complete this lab, you will need to use a remote desktop client.

> Windows: Microsoft Remote Desktop on Windows 10

> MacOS: Microsoft Remote Desktop

> Linux: Remmina
